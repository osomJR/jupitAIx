Authenticated-paid Business plan access guard.

Plan contract:
- unlimited use of every supported feature
- 2 to 19 subscribed accounts/users

This module intentionally does not consume rate-limit buckets. Subscription
status and team membership lookup should happen before this guard is called;
this guard only validates the feature and the plan's account-count boundary.
